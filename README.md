Group22: CAI Shizhan, CHEN Zixin, LIANG Haoran, ZHANG Weiwen

Please working with the file named "group22_project1.ipynb". And please comment your code whenever you modify something important.

DDL: *April 6, 2021*
- *March 23, 2021* release the validation score of weak baseline--60.2%
- *March 30, 2021* release the validation score of strong baseline

Submission: Each team leader is required to submit the groupNo.zip file in the canvas. It shoud contain 
- `pre.csv` Predictions on test data (please make sure you can successfully evaluate your validation predictions on the validation data with the help of evaluate.py)
- report (1-2 pages of pdf)
- code (Frameworks and programming languages are not restricted.)

We will check your report with your code and the accuracy.

| Grade | Classifier (80%)                                                   | Report (20%)                      |

| 50%   | example code in tutorials or in Project 1 without any modification | submission                        |
| 60%   | an easy baseline that most students can outperform                 | algorithm you used                |
| 80%   | a competitive baseline that about half students can surpass        | detailed explanation              |
| 90%   | a very competitive baseline without any special mechanism          | detailed explanation and analysis, such as explorative data analysis and ablation study |
| 100%  | a very competitive baseline with at least one mechanism            | excellent ideas, detailed explanation and solid analysis |


## Final Result:  
And our acc reached about 67% on validation set. The final model was Bert
